/// The IAAFTransition interface is implemented by objects describe a
/// change or transition from one piece of essence to another.
/// Transitions must exist in the context of a sequence\, and must be
/// surrounded on both sides by segments \(an object which has an
/// IAAFSegment interface\).
///
/// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
/// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
/// values:
/// 
/// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
///   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
///     operation.
///
/// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
///   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through
///     this object's primary interface.  Note that IAAFMob is a
///     primary interface for an abstract class\, so it is not
///     appropriate for the Initialize\(\) method to exist in this
///     interface.  The Initialize\(\) method is available through the
///     concrete object's primary interface.
