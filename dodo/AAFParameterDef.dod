/// The IAAFParameterDef interface is implemented by objects that

/// allow some parameters\, for example level\, to be specified once
/// for multiple operation definitions. Parmeter definitions define the
/// possible values and display units of a single operation parameter.

/// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
/// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
/// values:

/// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
