/// The IAAFMasterMobEx interface extends IAAFMasterMob.  It supports
/// extended essence.  Extended essence is represented by a Sequence of
/// SourceClip objects.  Each SourceClip refers to a SourceMob which
/// describes one chunk of essence.
///
/// Individual chunks of embedded essence are currently limited to 2GB
/// in size.  A Sequence of SourceClips provides the means to overcome
/// this limit.  There is no limit to the number of SourceClip objects
/// in the sequence or the sum total size of all essence in a file\,
/// other than those imposed by the underlying persistent object
/// store. It is expected that this will be significantly larger than
/// 2GB of essence data.
///
///
/// Essence can be extended at any time\, for any reason.  Typically\, it
/// will be extended because a CODEC returned an error indicating a
/// 2GB limit was reached.  To overcome this limit\, simply extend the
/// essence.
///
/// IAAFEssenceAccess::ReadSamples knows how to read embedded
/// essence.  This interface is created by IAAFMasterMob::OpenEssence
///
/// This interface returns the same errors as IAAFMasterMob::CreateEssence\,
/// and IAAFMasterMob::CreateMultiEssence.
