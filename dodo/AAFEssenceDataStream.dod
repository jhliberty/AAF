/// The IAAFEssenceDataStream interface is an additional interface implemented by objects
/// which stream over AAF files\, and were therefore created by the AAFContainerDef for
/// AAF files.  This interface allows the setting of one additional parameter \(a pointer
/// to the AAFEssenceData object to stream over\) which was not general-purpose enough
/// to be in the IAAFEssenceStream interface.
///
/// Objects which support this interface must be created by methods in IAAFContainerDef\, since
/// the container definition is what is used to differentiate between the different streams.
/// If the stream needs a reference to data other than a file pointer \(ex. the AAFContainer
/// makes a stream which needs a reference to a structureed storage stream\) will have another
/// interface to support the additional behaviour.  For an AAF container\, the additional interface
/// is IAAFEssenceDataStream.
///
/// The following has been copied from the IAAFEssenceStream interface:
///		The IAAFEssenceStream interface is an internal interface used by AAFEssenceAccess and
///		essence codecs to read the low-level representation of the essence.  There are multiple
///		classes implementing this interface\, each representing a different underlying container
///		holding the essence data.  The idea of \"container\" is separate from any formatting such
///		as WAVE or JPEG.  Examples of containers \(and therefore streams\)\, are essence embedded
///		in AAF files\, and essence in a file all by itself \(ex. a WAVE file\).
