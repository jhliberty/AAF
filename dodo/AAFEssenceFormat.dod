/// The AAFEssenceFormat class represents a collection of parameters
/// \(such as image height/width\, audio sample width\) which describes

/// contains a variable length piece of data.
///
/// When creating a piece of essence\, you should call
/// AddFormatSpecifier\(\) for each required or known parameter\, and
/// the codec will supply defaults for other optional parameters.
///
/// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
/// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
/// values:
/// 
/// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
///   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
///     operation.

/// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
///   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through
