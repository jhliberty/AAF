/// The IAAFDigitalImageDescriptor2 interface is implemented by objects
/// which describe video content data formatted either using RGBA or
/// luminance\/chrominance formatting.
///
/// The geometry properties accessed by Set/GetStoredView\(\)\,
/// Set/GetSampledView\(\)\, and Set/GetDisplayView\(\) describe the
/// dimensions and meaning of the stored pixels in the image.  The
/// geometry describes the pixels of an uncompressed image.
/// Consequently\, the geometry properties are independent of the
/// compression and subsampling.
///
/// Three separate geometries - stored\, sampled\, and display views -
/// are used to define a set of different views on uncompressed digital
/// data. All views are constrained to rectangular regions\, which means
/// that storage and sampling has to be rectangular.
/// 
/// The relationships among the views can be shown by the following
/// rectangles\, representing areas of a video image:
/// 
/// +------------------+
/// |                  |
/// |   Stored View    |
/// |                  |           +--------------+

/// The stored view is the entire data region corresponding to a single
/// uncompressed frame or field of the image\, and is defined by its
/// horizontal and vertical dimension properties. The stored view may
/// include data that is not derived from\, and would not usually be
/// translated back to\, analog data.
///
/// The sampled view is defined to be the rectangular dimensions in
/// pixels corresponding to the digital data derived from an analog or
/// digital source. These pixels reside within the rectangle defined by
/// the stored view. This would include the image and auxiliary
/// information included in the analog or digital source. For the
/// capture of video signals\, the mapping of these views to the
/// original signal is determined by the VideoLineMap property.
///
/// The display view is the rectangular size in pixels corresponding to
/// the viewable area. These pixels contain image data suitable for
/// scaling\, display\, warping\, and other image processing. The display
/// view offsets are relative to the stored view\, not to the sampled
/// view.
///
/// Although typically the display view is a subset of the sampled
/// view\, it is possible that the viewable area may not be a subset of
/// the sampled data. It may overlap or even encapsulate the sampled
/// data. For example\, a subset of the input image might be centered in
/// a computer-generated blue screen for use in a chroma key effect. In
/// this case the viewable pixels on disk would contain more than the
/// sampled image.
///
/// Each of these data views will have a width and height value. Both
/// the sampled view and the display view also have offsets relative to
/// the top left corner of the stored view.
///
/// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
/// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
/// values:
/// 
/// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
///   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
///     operation.
///
/// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
///   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through
///     this object's primary interface.  Note that
///     IAAFDigitalImageDescriptor2 is a primary interface for an
///     abstract class\, so it is not appropriate for the
///     Initialize\(\) method to exist in this interface.  The
///     Initialize\(\) method is available through the concrete
///     object's primary interface.
