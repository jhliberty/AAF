  # Test exclusion parameters:

  # The following CFG entries allow these exclusion rules to be turned
  # on/off.

  # These are CFG entries are a bit ad-hoc at the moment.  A better
  # approach might to let the tests fail, then check if the failure
  # was expected.  How could that be generically expressed?
  #
  # Versions  - array of library versions that do not support modify.
  # ByteOrder - exclude modify tests if the byte ordering of the

  # the MultiGenTest.pl script is run on a Win2K machine.  It is
  # assumed that executing the copy directly on the server will be the
  # fastest way to copy a file, hence, the copy command is executed on
  # that machine.

  CopyHost    => "Linux",

  # Finally, there must be one CFG entry for each test in the Tests
  # vector.  Each test entry is an array with the following syntax:
  #
  # Index 0 is the command option: "load" | "create" | "modify"
  #
  # "load": will form and execute a MultiGenTest command that simply
  # loads and unloads the COM library.
  #
  # "create": will form and execute a MultiGenTest command that
  # creates a new file and runs the command stored at index 1.  The
  # resulting .aaf file is verifying using the command at index 3.
  #
  # "modify": will form and execute a MultiGenTest command that
  # modifies an existing .aaf file.  Index 3 identifies the test that
  # created the file to be modified.  Index 1 is the MultiGenTest
  # command that modifies the file.  Index 2 is the MultiGenTest
  # command that verifies the result.
  #
  # In this example, TestOne creates a file and runs the AddMasterMobs
  # test to add two master mobs named A and B.  The verify command
  # checks that these mobs are found in the file.  TestTwo opens the
  # file created by TestOne, and adds two more master mobs named C and
  # D. The TestTwo verify command checks that all four mobs are found
  # in the file.
