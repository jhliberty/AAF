REQ_EP_112
Within a SourceMob, multi-channel audio shall be represented in either of the 
following ways: a single track with a multi-channel sound Data Definition and a
single audio EssenceDescriptor object of multiple channels; or multiple tracks
with a mono sound Data Definition and a MultipleDescriptor containing the same
number of mono audio EssenceDescriptors.
7.8
> If it is represented in an illegal way, how do we determine that
> multi-channel audio is being represented?

REQ_EP_113
To reference a single channel of a multi-channel track from a mono track, the 
SourceReference::ChannelIDs property shall be used with a single element in the
array.
7.8
> This is a pass condition, what constitutes a fail?

REQ_EP_114
To reference multiple channels of a multi-channel track from a multi-channel 
track, the SourceReference::ChannelIDs property shall be used with multiple
elements in the array.
7.8
> This is a pass condition, what constitutes a fail?

REQ_EP_115
To reference multiple mono tracks from a multi-channel track, the 
SourceReference::MonoSourceSlotIDs shall be used with multiple elements in the
array.
7.8
> This is a pass condition, what constitutes a fail?

REQ_EP_116
When exporting multi-channel essence as a single file SourceMob where the 
multi-channel essence requires a codec that is not widely avaliable, the
exporting application should also export the individual channels as separate
essence and file SourceMobs, linked into the Mob reference chain.
7.8.1
> How do we determine it multi-channel essence requires a codec that is not
> widely avaliabe?
> How do we check (to present a warning) if the individual channels are
> exported as separate essence.

REQ_EP_121
A clip with multiple file source choices shall be specified using an 
EssenceGroup object in a MasterMob.
7.9
> Is this a definition?  If not, how do we know that a clip has multiple file
> source choices and what would be a fail condition?

DEF_EP_129
A track of timecode shall be specified using one or more Timecode objects or a 
TimecodeStream12M object.
7.11
> This is a definition.

REQ_EP_137
An AAF Mob (such as an AAF composition) may reference an auxiliary SourceMob 
using a SourceReference (or sub-class thereof) from a DataDef_Auxiliary Slot in
the referencing Mob to the DataDef_Auxiliary Slot in the auxiliary SourceMob.
9.1.1
> This is a MAY requirement

REQ_EP_138
An embedded auxiliary file shall be specified using an EssenceData object 
containing the auxiliary file data.  The EssenceData object is linked to the
auxiliary SourceMob using a common MobID.
9.1.1
> Is this a definition?  If not, what is being tested?

REQ_EP_142
No more than one MIDI auxiliary file shall be referenced from a given 
composition.
9.2
> How you determine if a MIDI auxiliary file is being referenced?
>

REQ_EP_143
A referenced MIDI file shall conform to the standard MIDI specification version 
1.
9.2
> OK if we can find a good parser.  The one at
> http://www.jdkoftinoff.com/main/Free_Projects/C++_MIDI_Library/ might work,
> but I'd like to know if something else is being used elsewhere in AAF code. 
> If not, I'd like to get someone else opinion on if this library will work.

REQ_EP_148
The Data Definition for non-essence tracks containing annotations shall be 
DataDef_DescriptiveMetadata.
10.1
> What object do I need to check the data definition of?  Is it just getting the
> Data Definition of a mob slot of any non-essence track that has an object
> under it which contains annotations?

REQ_EP_169
Multiple effects sharing common material shall be constructed within a 
NestedScope object.  A continuous section of common material, used by several
effects, shall be represented as a single segment in the NestedScope.
11.2.3

REQ_EP_172
A nested group of tracks within a Segment of a CompositionMob shall be specified
using a NestedScope object.
11.4
> This is a definition.

REQ_EP_173
A ScopeReference shall reference an existing MobSlot or NestedScope track.
11.4.2
> Is there anything else that it can reference?  How does this test fail?

REQ_EP_178
Effects that take multiple video inputs shall have all of their parameters VH 
normalized to the first video input unless explicitly stated otherwise in the
effect definition.
11.6
> How do we check that they are normalized?  How is it otherwise stated?

REQ_EP_191
The Edit Protocol deprecates the use of specifying a Video Repeat Effect by 
using a SourceClip in a TimelineMobSlot that references a still frame in a
StaticMobSlot.  An exporting application shall not use this representation and
an importing application need not accept it.
12.4.1
> OK: if this means that a video source clip in a timeline mob slot can not
> reference a StaticMobSlot.

REQ_EP_238
A Mono Audio Pan effect shall only be applied to audio tracks that refer to mono
essence.
12.18
> How do you determine if a track refers to Mono essence?

applied.
