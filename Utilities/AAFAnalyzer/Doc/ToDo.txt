1) The TestResult class needs some refinement:
   - It should stored a hiearchy of test results.
   - We break down the tests into:
	- A TestPhase
	- A TestPhase executes one or more Tests.
	- A Test is implemented (typically) using one or more Visitors.
   - When a failure occurs, each of these have a result to report.
   - We need to keep a record of the results from top, to bottom,
     with increasing levels of detail.
   - A tree of TestResults would do the job. If necessary we could
     specialize the test results to represent TestPhase results, and
     Test results, and the details results that are created as a result
     of teh processing done by one Test.

2) TestResult takes for strings. It's easy to mixup what's what. Can
that be improved?  First, can the document reference be made into a
class that stores a precise document refernce (is section, subsection,
etc). Is it worth it?

3) Some of Demitri's low level test results are not being propogated
up. This requires review.
