/****************************************************************
Name:
	class LoggerBase
Description:
	Base class for run-time logging system.
	The idea is to be able to set different levels of
	logging verbosity one wants by setting the log level.

Notes:

	There are two different modes: Mask and Level.

	Using the level mode:
		The level parameter is to represent a range of levels
		from (0 - level).
		To increase verbosity, set the log level higher.
		Messages logged with a lower level are more urgent
		than messages with a higher level. 
		For example, in a five-level error logging system (0-4)
		messages logged at level 0 represent severe errrors and
		exceptions, while messages logged at level 4 represent
		informational messages. Setting the log level to 0
		guarantees that *only* level 0 (severe errors) are logged. 
		Setting the level to 4 guarantees that *all* messages logged 
		with levels in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} (sever thru informational) 
		will get logged.


	Using the mask mode:
		The level parameter is used as a mask to break up messages 
		into logically discrete categories with each bit representing a
		category.  To increase verbosity, by logging messages of a 
		given category, set the bits on for the category in question.

  	The level can be changed at any time, but isMask
	is set once when the object is constructed. The idea is
	that you must make up your mind up front on whether to 
	use mask vs. levels and not mix and match them in mid-stream. 

  The helper class VaList is there because the definition of va_list
  is:

  typedef char *va_list;

  This causes problems with calls like

  Log( level, "bla, bla, bla %s\n", "A string" );

  because the compiler can't distinguish between "A string" and
  a va_list.
