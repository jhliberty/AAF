# This script strips escaped returns such as is found at the end of this line \
# from stdin and writes the result to stdout.
#
# Stripping escaped returns makes it easier to filter known good
# commands from make file logs that include commands that are split over
# several lines using escaped returns.

while ( <STDIN> ) {
	s/\\\n/ /gi ; # replace escaped returns with a space
	print $_;
