# This make file is normally called from the top level makefile
# (../GNUmakefile) using the "dist" target.

# Windows Notes:
#
# The top level make target does not currently work under Windows.
# Instead, run the following from this directory:
#
#    make AAFPLATFORM=Win AAFSDK=../AAFWinSDK/vs10 WINPLATFORM={Win32|x64} release-dist
#    make AAFPLATFORM=Win AAFSDK=../AAFWinSDK/vs10 WINPLATFORM={Win32|x64} sdk-dist
# 
# It was tested using Cygwin.

# Note, as of V109 the SDK no longer supports OS9. As of V1.1.6 the officially supported
# OSX targets are i386Darwin and x86_64Darwin.
