  /// any other method can be called.

  /// - Initialize() has not yet been called on this object.
  /// - pName is a valid pointer.
  /// - pTypeDef is a valid pointer and registered
  /// - pValue is a valid pointer

  // the listed errors is in effect, it will return the first one
  // encountered in the order given below:
  // 
  // AAFRESULT_SUCCESS
  //   - succeeded.  (This is the only code indicating success.)
