  // Initialize()
  //
  // Initializes this type def to be a reference to objects of
  /// the given type, and assigns this object the given AUID.  pObjType
  /// points to the class definition of the least-derived class which
  /// is possible to be contained in property values of this type.
  /// 
  /// pTargetSet points to an array of Property Def AUIDs which
  /// indicate the location of the property containing the target of
  /// this weak reference.  The AUIDs indicate the containment path to
  /// the target property, starting at the root Header object.  For
  /// example, if the containment hierarchy is:
  ///
  /// Header->A->B->C
  ///
  /// then the first AUID corresponds to the Header's property which
  /// contains Object A; the second AUID corresponds to Object A's
  /// property which contains Object B; and the third AUID corresponds
  /// to Object B's property C which contans the target of this weak
  /// reference.  If any intermediate property is a vector or set,
  /// *all* objects in that vector or set are searched for the target.
  /// Note that the final AUID *must* correspond to a Set property.
  /// 
  /// The number of AUIDs in pTargetSet is noted by ids.
  /// 
  /// This method must be called after allocation, and before
  /// any other method can be called.
  ///
  /// Succeeds if:
  /// - Initialize() has not yet been called on this object.
  /// - pObjType is a valid pointer.
  /// - pTargetSet is a valid pointer.
  //
  // This method will return the following codes.  If more than one of
  // the listed errors is in effect, it will return the first one
  // encountered in the order given below:
  // 
  // AAFRESULT_SUCCESS
  //   - succeeded.  (This is the only code indicating success.)
  //
  // AAFRESULT_ALREADY_INITIALIZED
  //   - This object has already had Initialize() called on it.
  //
  // AAFRESULT_NULL_PARAM
  //   - pObjType, pTypeName, or pTargetSet arg is NULL.
